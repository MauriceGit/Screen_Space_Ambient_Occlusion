# Screen-Space-Ambient-Occlusion

This programm is a complete implementation of Screen-Space-Ambient-Occlusion.
The occlusion happens directly in the fragment-Shader on the GPU and happens mostly in real time.

It brings out some really satisfying results by shading parts of the scene which are probably occluded.
All parameters can be adjusted at runtime. 
All possible parameters are listed if you press h/H in the running demo.
